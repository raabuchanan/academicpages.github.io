I am a Canadian robotics researcher with expertise in perception and path planning for autonomous mobile systems. I completed my bachelor's degree in Honours Electrical Engineering at McGill University in Montréal, Canada. I am currently finishing my master's degree in Robotics, Systems and Control at ETH Zürich in Zürich, Switzerland. The thesis work was carried out at the CSIRO [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://research.csiro.au/robotics/) in Brisbane, Australia.
