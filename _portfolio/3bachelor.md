This was my bachelor honours thesis done in 2015 and supervised by Prof. Meyer Nahon from the Aerospace Mechatronics Lab at McGill University. The goal was to use use infrared markers on a moving platform to guide a micro aerial vehicle to landing. This was done by solving the PnP on an Arduino microcontroller.
