I am an PhD Student at the [Dynamic Robot Systems Lab](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/drs/) where I research multi-modal perception for legged robots.

I received my Master of Science in Robotics, Systems and Control from ETH Zürich at the [Robotic Systems Lab](http://www.rsl.ethz.ch/). My Master's thesis was done in collaboration with the [CSIRO Data61 Robotics and Autonomous Systems Group](https://research.csiro.au/robotics/) in Brisbane, Australia.

I received my Bachelor of Electrical Engineering Honours from McGill University in my home city of Montréal, Canada.
