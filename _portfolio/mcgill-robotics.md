For three years in during my bachelor's degree at McGill University I was heavily involved in the student team [McGill Robotics](www.mcgillrobotics.com). In 2016 I was leader of a 70 person team in designing and building an autonomous underwater vehicle. We competed at the AUVSI [RoboSub](https://www.robonation.org/competition/robosub) competition and reached the finals, placing 7th out of 50 international teams.
