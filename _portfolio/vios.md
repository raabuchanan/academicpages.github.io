This was my semester thesis project done in Spring 2017 and supervised by Inkyu Sa and Zachary Taylor from the Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH. The goal was to use intertial data from an IMU to improve tracking in ORB_SLAM for micro aerial vehicles. I did this improvement by using the IMU to integrate a better velocity model for feature matching.
