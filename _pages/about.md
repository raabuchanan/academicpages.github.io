I am an engineer at the [Robotic Systems Lab](http://www.rsl.ethz.ch/) where I work on [multi sensor synchronization](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/hardware_time_sync/wiki), mapping and path planning for autonomout mobile systems.

I received my Master of Science in Robotics, Systems and Control from ETH Zürich in Zürich, Switzerland. My Master's thesis was done in collaboration with the [CSIRO Data61 Robotics and Autonomous Systems Group](https://research.csiro.au/robotics/) in Brisbane, Australia.

I received my Bachelor of Electrical Engineering Honours from McGill University in my home city of Montréal, Canada.
